# vChallenge
Case Study provided by Alex Nastetsky from Verve Group

I had some fun this weekend working with this. :)
Mainly Programmed with Jupyter Notebook 
vChallenge5.ipynb has all the intenal documents inside.

Questions 1,2 used mainly used Python in Jupyter
Questinn 3, Used Spark and had difficulty with setting up Environment(Spark,winUtils.exe...)

Spark-testing.txt file is my worklog for Troubleshooting issues.

I did my best to guess the problems , so hopefully my guess is not off the chart.

Thanks a lot , hoping to talk to you guys soon
