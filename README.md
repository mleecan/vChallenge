# vChallenge
Case Study provided by Alex Nastetsky from Verve Group

I had some fun this weekend working with this. :)
Mainly Programmed with Jupyter Notebook 
vChallenge5.ipynb has all the intenal documents inside.

Questions 1,2 used mainly used Python in Jupyter - Output file - 
Questinn 3, Used Spark and had difficulty with setting up Environment(Spark,winUtils.exe...)
I could not get the top 5 advertiser_id, only the max one. - Did not have enough time for this. 

Spark-testing.txt file is my worklog for Troubleshooting issues.

I did my best to guess the problems , so hopefully my guess is not off the chart.

Thanks a lot , hoping to talk to you guys soon
